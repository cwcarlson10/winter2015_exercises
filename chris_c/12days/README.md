Please describe why you chose to present this project and what do you think it's the best or most accomplishing feature:

    I chose to present this project because of the features and styling that I was able to incorporate within the application.  I also felt like I was very efficiant as far as completing the desired features of the app is concerned.  What I feel most accompleshed about is being able to install divise and the paperclip gem and have them both working properly.

## Challenges

- What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome them? Be candid.
    What I found to be most challangeing was installing the paperclip gem for the first time.  I overcame it by looking at other examples of the gem and following the instructions on its gitHub page.

- Based on this project, what do you want to learn more of?
    I would like to learn more about differnt gems including divise and paperclip as well as how to use them effectively.
